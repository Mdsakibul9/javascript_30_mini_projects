# 📚 JavaScript 30 – Wes Bos

This repository contains my daily progress through the **[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)** course by Wes Bos.  
The course features 30 fun and interactive projects built using **vanilla JavaScript** — no libraries, no frameworks, no compilers.

## 🔨 What You'll Find Here

Each folder represents a standalone project that demonstrates key JavaScript concepts, such as:

- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- Array methods  
- LocalStorage  
- Audio and video APIs  
- HTML5 Canvas  
- Keyboard input and more

## 🎯 Goals

- Reinforce and deepen understanding of core JavaScript  
- Build 30 real-world mini projects from scratch  
- Practice writing clean, modern JavaScript without relying on frameworks

## 🚀 Daily Uploads

I will be uploading **one project per day** as I make my way through the course.
